# TibcoKafkaConnector
A custom Kafka connector for TIBCO version 5.x
This code uses set and get methods to get variable values.
For this code to work this way, you would need to first add a Java code activity in your TIBCO Designer, and then add input parameters.
Place values in these parameters with a mapper beforehand.
